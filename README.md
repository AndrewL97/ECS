This is a simple C++ header-only entity component system library. It makes heavy use of C++11
constructs, so make sure you have an up to date compiler. It isn't meant to do absolutely everything,
so please feel free to modify it when using. There's a VS2015 solution provided, but it should
compile on any standard compiler with C++11 support.
